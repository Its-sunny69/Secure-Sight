## ðŸ›  Tech Decisions

**Frontend**

* **Next.js 15** - App Router for modern React patterns
* **TypeScript** - Type safety and better DX
* **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
* **SVG Timeline** - Better performance than Canvas

**Backend**

* **Prisma + PostgreSQL** - Type-safe database operations
* **Next.js API Routes** - Serverless functions
* **UTC timestamps** - Consistent timezone handling

**Key Choices**

* SVG over Canvas for timeline (better accessibility)
* Prisma over raw SQL (type safety)
* Component-based architecture (maintainability)

- Built a 3D model-based homepage with animations and interactions across all pages using motion 
- Made the entire site fully responsive for mobile and tablet devices  
- Implemented light mode toggle for better user experience 
- Used Redux or Context API for global state management
